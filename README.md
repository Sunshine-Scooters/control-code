# Sunshine Scooters Control Code

Device control code for the Sunshine Scooters project.

## How to Use

Add the source code files contained with the `src/` directory to your Arduino Create IDE.

## Notes on Cytron PS2 Shield Dependency

This code depends on the Cytron PS2 Shield driver code which is available here: 

https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/Cytron_PS2Shield 

It is included in this repository as a convenience since the Cytron code has not been updated in over 5 years. However, any future revisions to that code should be referenced back to the original repository located above.
